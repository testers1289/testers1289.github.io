# Discord-like Demo Website

This repository contains a minimal demo of a Discord-like web app: channels, messages, search, create/delete channels and messages, and basic username-only authentication. Data is stored in `data.json` on the backend so changes are shared between users.

This README explains how the app works, how to run it locally, and how to publish the frontend to GitHub Pages while hosting the backend on a platform like Vercel or Render.

This is a basic demo.
